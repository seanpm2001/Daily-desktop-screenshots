# Desktop Lingo

## A glossary of terms and usage of my desktop file structure usage

My desktop can be pretty weird. This glossary will go through uncommon traditions I have with naming files and folders on the desktop.

***

## Random file extensions

I can be a little careless at times. When using Linux (and on Windows as well) I will give an ordinary text file an unfitting name and an unfitting file extension (.apk, .cpp, .c, .exe, .dmg, .vala, etc.) to mark the importance of the file so I go to the notes and perform the task I held off. This doesn't always work, and may look unusual. It works when there are fewer, eye catching files

## JIN

JIN (Pre-journaling Journaling notes, originally JN) is an acronym I give to notes I accumulate for my daily journaling process throughout the day. I started doing this after my text editor nearly crashed and destroyed all my notes, so I started naming the files I worked on, no matter how incomplete. The JN note file isn't a complete acronym, and it was changed a little bit later on to be catchier. 

I named it JIN after the [Jin dynasty in Ancient China (266 CE to 420 CE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(266%E2%80%93420)) as I like Asian Culture and wanted to represent it here. However, later on, I found out that people might confuse this for a K-Pop star that goes by [Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_seok-Jin) as well, however I never knew about him until searching to see what JIN would refer to. Please note that he is not the subject of this acronym.

If you are confused about something, point out something on my desktop, ask me about it, and I will give context on it when I have time. Report your questions [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Daily-desktop-screenshots/issues/)
