### Can't upload 3 files

3 videos couldn't be uploaded to the Year 1 folder due to the GitHub 25 megabyte limit (all 3 videos were over 300 megabytes in size)

I won't fix this, unless GitHub were to change the upload limit or grant an exception, but I don't see any of these options happening anytime soon.
