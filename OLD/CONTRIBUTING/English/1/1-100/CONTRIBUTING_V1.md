# CONTRIBUTING

I am not accepting contributers for this project. This is a personal project that I am easily able to handle. I don't need to update it very frequently, and I am the only person who has access to all the files before upload.

You can remind me if I forget to update after 100 days, but that is the only contribution I am accepting here.
