# About
# I decided to make GNU Make (Makefile) the main project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Daily-desktop-screenshots) as it is currently the only functional programming/scripting language for this project. It could have been markdown, but then that would apply to every project, it could have been YAML, but YAML doesn't relate to this project, so GNU Make was chosen.
