# Pictures of Ukraine

## Why?

I go through different regions, getting screenshots of notable and beautiful scenery from cities around the world, but mostly in Europe, to set as my desktop wallpaper for a day. Due to the ongoing Russian Invasion of Ukraine, I have resumed Ukrainian photography.

## Quality note

I am getting pictures from before the Russo-Ukrainian war, which started in 2014, and also before the 2022 Russian Invasion. I have to remind myself of this and I want to let others know, that the pictures I am getting are nearly a decade old or older, as of 2022. 4K wasn't very common in 2013 and earlier, so most pictures are in 720p or 1080p (sometimes I have to resort to 480p) 4K photos are exceptionally rare from this time period, these are the best public domain/Creative Commons photos I could find. They are not bad quality, they are just really old. It is kind of sad to know that 2013 is now considered so old, I can't believe it had been nearly a full decade now.

The reason I am getting older photos is because I don't want to see the devastation of the Russo-Ukrainian war on my desktop, and I want to give viewers a taste of Ukraine before all these horrible doings occurred. I may get photos from 2014 or later from time to time, but I don't come across them very often.
