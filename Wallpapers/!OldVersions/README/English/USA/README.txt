# Wallpapers collective

My wallpaper collection is titled ClassicShell, as my Daily Desktop Screenshot process picked up with the usage of ClassicShell, and by this time, several screenshots had been taken and needed to be placed in a directory. ClassicShell has remained the name, and it remains the same since.

**Version used:** [`ClassicShell 4.3.1`](http://www.classicshell.net/downloads/) an `*.exe` file (English) is also included in the current directory. Users still wishing to use this software should instead look at [:octocat: `Open-Shell`](https://github.com/Open-Shell/) as Classicshell was barely supported on Windows 10 when I used it over 3 years ago, and I feel as though it may not work on Windows 11 or newer.

**Reason for use:** Windows 10 is too ugly and uncustomizable to start with, and I had been going through Windows nostalgia around this time, and wanted to make my computer look more like Windows XP (and later, other versions of Windows) I no longer use Windows, as of 2020 July 9th, so the name is obsolete.

## Subdirectories

The ClassicShell collective has 4 main sub-directories:

- [`Laptop`](/Wallpapers/Classicshell/Laptop/) - For wallpapers used on my laptops
- [`Mobile`](/Wallpapers/Classicshell/Mobile/) - For mobile phone/PDA wallpapers (hardly ever used, no screenshots are taken, as of 2023, July 24th)
- [`Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge`](/Wallpapers/Classicshell/Samsung%20Galaxy%20S7%20Edge/) - For the wallpapers used on my former Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge
- [`WINSPOTL`](/Wallpapers/Classicshell/WINSPOTL/) - For the wallpapers collected through Windows Spotlight, a web-reliant lock screen wallpaper feature in Windows 10.

The most actively used is [`Laptop`](/Wallpapers/Classicshell/Laptop/)
