as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Daily-desktop-screenshots/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Daily-desktop-screenshots
This repository houses my daily desktop screenshots since I started on April 17th 2018. I intend to make this like one of those early YouTube videos where someone takes a picture of themself every day for over a decade and puts it into a time lapse 4 minute video.

***

## About

See above. This project hosts my daily desktop screenshots since April 17th 2018, similar to a "picture of [blank] every day of their life for x years" video, which was a trend in the early-mid 2000s/2010s. Here is an example: [(YouTube link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfqpqiTMUEg)

***

## History

_This project has a longish history, but not that much data to display._

I started getting daily desktop screenshots on April 17th 2018 under Windows 10.

On July 9th 2020, I switched to Linux, specifically Ubuntu 20.04. As of July 22nd 2021, I am still using Ubuntu 20.04.

On July 12th 2020, I copied the project to GitHub. The project has been updated daily since then.

On November 13th 2020, I created a project containing the original structure from the journaling archive. It is obsolete as of January 1st 2021. [Link to the obsolete project](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_daily-desktop-screenshots/)

On July 22nd 2021, this project received a modernization, and along with this, the README.md file (that you are currently reading) was greatly improved)

## Version history

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
